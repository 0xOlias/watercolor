Dev server for artblocks-compatible projects using p5

Only requirement is a src/index.ts that exports a `setup` and `draw` function

Run `yarn dev` to start the dev server at `http://localhost:8081`

This is basically an update to [tiny-artblocks](https://github.com/mattdesl/tiny-artblocks) to include TypeScript and p5 support
